Hi there! I'm **Arman Hossain**, a professional web scraper and data extraction expert with years of hands-on experience in turning the web's scattered data into structured, actionable insights.

## What I Do

I specialize in web scraping and data extraction techniques, working across the entire spectrum from simple HTTP requests to complex browser automation and AI-powered data pipelines. My toolkit includes:

- **Browser Automation**: Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, Nodriver, Camoufox, Ulixee/Hero
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and whatever else gets the job done
- **Techniques**: API interception, headless browsing, data parsing, proxy management, anti-bot circumvention

Whether it's extracting product data from e-commerce sites, monitoring competitor pricing, gathering market research, or building automated data collection systems, I've tackled it all.

## Why ByteTunnels?

This blog exists because web scraping is both an art and a science that's constantly evolving. Every day brings new challenges: sites update their anti-bot measures, new JavaScript frameworks emerge, and data structures change. I created ByteTunnels to share real-world solutions, techniques, and insights from the trenches.

Here, you'll find:

- **Practical tutorials** with working code examples
- **Problem-solving approaches** for common (and uncommon) scraping challenges
- **Tool comparisons** and recommendations based on actual usage
- **Advanced techniques** for bypassing modern web defenses
- **Data pipeline strategies** for scaling your extraction operations

## My Approach

I believe in learning by doing. Every post here comes from actual projects and real problems I've encountered. You won't find theoretical fluff – just practical solutions that work in production environments.

The web scraping landscape changes rapidly, and staying ahead means constantly experimenting with new tools, techniques, and approaches. I'm here to share what works, what doesn't, and why.

Welcome to ByteTunnels – where data extraction meets practical expertise.
